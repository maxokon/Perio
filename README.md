# Perio
Perio. is a mood and symptoms tracker centred around menstrual cycle. Project for COMP1004


Project Vision

My vision for this project is to enable users to track their menstrual cycle and symptoms they experience along the cycle phases. ​
This application will allow users to observe and spot patterns, which in return will make them more aware of how their bodies behave across their cycles. ​
With user-friendly, neutral design, my web app will be less alienating and more inclusive for people who do not identify as women. ​

Disclaimer: Menstrual health is a complex issue, and I am not in any way a medical professional. ​
All my understanding of the topic comes from personal experiences and countless conversations with other people  who menstruate and/or experience symptoms of PMS or PMDD.​
Perio is not a medical app, and it should not be treated as such. Rather than that, it is just a simple symptom and mood tracker focusing on menstrual cycle.



USER STORIES : 

#GENERAL
As a user, I want to be able to log in and have my own profile so no one else can see my data.
As a person, who doesn't identify as a woman, I want my profile to have a neutral, non overly feminine theme.

#PERIOD
As a person with irregular periods, I want to set the length of my cycle and the length of my period myself, instead of following the most common 28-days cycle pattern, so that the app is tailored to my cycle.
As a busy person, I want to receive notifications about an incoming period, so I can prepare in time.
As a person experiencing painful periods, I want to be able to track the pain intensity and how heavy my flow is, so I can spot if there are any patterns to that.

#BIRTH CONTROL
As a person on birth control, I want to pick my own type of birth control, and if they do change the cycle, I want to be able to set my own method of taking them. 
As a person on birth control, I want to receive a daily reminder to take a birth control pill if my chosen method requires me to take it every day.
As a person on birth control, I want to receive notifications about renewing my method of birth control.

#MOOD TRACKER
As a person experiencing PMS (premenstrual syndrome) or PMDD (premenstrual dysphoric disorder), I want to be able to view in which phase of my cycle I am in and  track my mood and symptoms, so I can see if there are any patterns.
As a busy person, I want to measure my stress level to see if it has any impact on my symptoms or my period.
As a person who has specific needs, I want to be able to add my own symptoms, as they may be different from other people's.
